i'm a human borned several months before the fall of Berlin's wall.  
So i'm borned before the end of History (hello Francis Fukuyama, how are you man ?)  
I grew up in Belgium, in a smalltown between Charleroi and La Louvière ,surrounded by   
italian dialect mixed with wallon dialect.
I studied art at a school called **ERG** (for _Ecole de Recherche Graphique_), 
after that i was too poor to just be an artist, so i worked as an art teacher.
Since my teenage i produce music, i started at 14 by practicing guitar by myself. 
I had some cover bands with friends, but it was litteraly "_claqué au sol_".
At 15 or 16 i had my first proper PC, in my bedroom. I quickly discovered Fruity Loops
and decided to cracked it (hehe sorry guyz). I discovered the power of MAO and above all that we can make music without any fucking classic rules (i already knew it but i tought it was too far from me)
So i beginned to produce some harsh noise (it means very noisy piece of music) and drony stuff (drone kinda means )))))))))))))))))))))))))), and started my first myspace page. 
Today i always make music in my bedroom (but i share my bedroom, so it's different)
